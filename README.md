In this program, you will be using __ShopIT__. 

This is an app / webpage, the user can: 
- add items to their list. 
- edit existing list items and clear the list.

These are the instructions that will enable you to run the program and use it. 

During the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. 

You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.

- **Add Item**: The user can enter an item in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.

- **Clear List**: The user can click the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

-**Edit**: The user can select an item from the list using the "Edit" button and make necessary changes (usually if the user had a misstypo, or keyed in the wrongitem).

### Acknowledges

This project was created as an exercise to practice DOM manipulation and event handling with JavaScript.

I used the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor to write the _**HTML**_, _**CSS**_ and _**Javascript**_ used to create the webpage.
