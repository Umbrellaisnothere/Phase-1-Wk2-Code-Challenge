# Interactive Shopping List
---
This challenge combines array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling to create an interactive shopping list application.

### Objective:

Develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

### Requirements:

**Array**: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

**DOM Manipulation**:
- Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
- Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
- Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).

**Event Handling**:
- Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
- Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
- Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.


## Introduction
----

In this program, you will be using __ShopIT__. 

This is an app / webpage, the user can: 
- add items to their list. 
- edit existing list items and clear the list.

These are the instructions that will enable you to run the program and use it. 

During the process of ideation and planning your app: deciding on your user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. 

You should work through all the planning steps before you start doing any coding.


### Instructions
---

In order to use the webpage;
- Fork the repository provided 
```https://github.com/Umbrellaisnothere/Phase-1-Wk2-Code-Challenge.git```
- Create a new / feature -branch.
- Make the appropriate changes in the files.
- Make changes in order to commit to the changes made.
- Commit your changes (git commit -m 'changes commited')
- Push to the branch (git push origin).
- Create a Pull Request......and then you are done! ü•≥ü´°üëèüèΩ

### The Features and Explanation

- **Add Item**: The user can enter an item in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.

- **Clear List**: The user can click the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

- **Edit**: The user can select an item from the list using the "Edit" button and make necessary changes (usually if the user had a misstypo, or keyed in the wrongitem).

### Acknowledges

This project was created as an exercise to practice DOM manipulation and event handling with JavaScript.

I used the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor to write the _**HTML**_, _**CSS**_ and _**Javascript**_ used to create the webpage.
